	abstract = {This study evaluated the basal area growth of Norway spruce stands subjected to different management strategies; specifically, even-aged ({EA}) stands treated with thinning from below and uneven-aged ({UEA}) stands treated with selective cutting. Analysis was based on extensive empirical data obtained from permanent longterm experiments established in 23 even-aged and 26 uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in Southern and Central Finland. The specific goals were to determine whether there are differences in: (a) the relationship between the stocking level and the stand basal area growth, (b) the stand basal area growth rates at a given stocking level, and (c) the stand basal area growth responses to cuttings between {EA} and {UEA} stands. A model-based approach was adopted in the analysis. Modelling was used to describe general trends and patterns in the data, emphasising the effects of overall stand density, cutting intensity, and management strategy on post-treatment stand growth. A model for a stand basal-area growth was fitted as a mixed linear model to the pooled data from {EA} and {UEA} stands. Model simulations were conducted to elucidate how the treatment of stands affects the predicted stand basal area growth.},

	abstract = {In Fennoscandia there is still lack of information for comparing the traditional even-aged management approach, or Rotation Forestry ({RF}), with the alternative uneven-aged management, or Continuous Cover Forestry ({CCF}), especially at tree level. We compared the basal area growth of more than 9000 individual Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), repeatedly measured in long-term permanent sample plots in both {RF} and {CCF} stands (the latter managed with single tree selection). We ﬁtted a descriptive model considering characteristics related to tree growth potential (tree size and crown ratio), stand characteristics, site fertility, and management activities (namely forest management type, intensity and timing of last cutting before growth). Variables related to the individual tree characteristics were the most important predictors for growth. The model included two competition indexes, asymmetric (based on total basal area) and symmetric (based on on the amount of overtopping), which had both a stronger negative eﬀect in {CCF} than in {RF}. Stand development stage (expressed by the mean height) had a slightly negative eﬀect only in {RF}. Variables directly describing the intensity and timing of the cuttings had such a negligible eﬀect in both management systems that they were discarded, likely due to their already indirect eﬀects on modifying the stand-level structure (i.e. in reducing the competition eﬀect). Concluding, we successfully ﬁtted a biologically sound and accurate descriptive model that can be used in the ongoing comparison of the two management approaches. {CCF} trees had a consistently lower growth due to a stronger eﬀect of the competition variables in the model. Our methods show that there is need to account for the diﬀerences in the forest structure when building a model aimed at diﬀerent management systems.},

	abstract = {Most studies comparing the predictive performance of distance-independent and -dependent competition metrics have been conducted in even-aged, single species stands. In addition, past studies have generally not considered more sophisticated distance-dependent competition metrics such as open sky-view or light interception indices. Using data from fully stem mapped inventory plots (n = 260) established in structurally complex, mixed-species experimental forests (n = 5) in the Northeastern {US}, we evaluated prediction performance of one- and two-sided distance-dependent as well as more conventional distance-independent competition metrics in both annualized diameter increment (n = 1735) and probability of survival models (n = 1953) developed across 26 contrasting softwood and hardwood species. Prediction accuracy of non-spatial and spatial models was further assessed by classifying observations by species shade-tolerance, relative tree height, time since harvest, and tree clumping. Our analyses revealed no general superiority of distance-dependent competition metrics over their distanceindependent counterparts for either diameter increment or survival, which was particularly true for the latter variable. Distance-dependent metrics tended to outperform distance-independent ones for observations from shade-tolerant species, trees of lower crown classes, and immediately after harvest. However, results on the comparative analysis of the predictive power of the different types of competition metrics under varying stand conditions and situations were often inconsistent and not always conclusive. In addition, model complexity, i.e. number of non-spatial explanatory variables in the base model, strongly affected the performance of distancedependent competition metrics. Our findings thus appear to support the critical assumption that distance-independent competition metrics are sufficient for most operational growth and yield applications, even in managed, naturally-regenerated and species rich forests.},
